      <p>I have wrestled since I was five years
        old. I started when my uncle invited me
        after he had just finished his high school
        carrer. I started out only winning two
        matches my first year of competing.
        After that year I took off winning
        multiple states titles and eventual
        national titles as well. As I entered
        junior high I took a year off from
        wrestling after burning out.
        <br><br>
        I wasn't sure if I would continue to
        wrestle in high school, but sure enough
        I continued. My placements in high school
        were as follows.
        <ul>
          <li>Freshman:5th</li><br>
          <li>Sophmore:2nd</li><br>
          <li>Junior:2nd</li><br>
          <li>Senior:3rd</li><br>
        </ul>
